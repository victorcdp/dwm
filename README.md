# Features & patches
- Launch anything on startup by editing `~/.config/dwm/autostart.sh` file (see [autostart](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/autostart/)).
- Extensive control on bar with [barmodules](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/barmodules/) patch (with systray).
- Cycle through layouts with `Mod+(shift+)tab` (see [cyclelayouts](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/cyclelayouts/)).
- Cycle through non-empty tags with `Alt+(shift+)tab` (see [shiftviewclients](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/shiftviewclients/)).
- Use Xresources variables to set colors, borderpx, barheight and more (see [xresources](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/xresources/)).
- Make clients go fullscreen or fake fullscreen with `Mod+(shift+)f` (see [fullscreen-compilation](https://github.com/bakkeby/patches/wiki/fullscreen-compilation/)).
- Use layout, nmaster, mfact, gaps, & bar on per tag basis (see [pertag](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag/)).

# Touchpad functionality
To get [natural scrolling with touchpad](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1122513/how-to-add-natural-inverted-mouse-scrolling-in-i3-window-manager/), edit `/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf` file:
```
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "libinput touchpad catchall"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/event*"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "True"
EndSection
```

To [enable taping on touchpad](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Libinput#Via_Xorg_configuration_file/), create a file `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-touchpad.conf`:
```
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad catchall"
        Driver "libinput"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
EndSection
```
